      <description>About me Hello!
My name is Frederik Fibiger-Lundberg, I was born in Denmark back in October 1996, and I work with IT Networks for a living!
I started my IT journey in the Danish Broadcasting Cooperation (DR) as a data technician apprentice back in March 2015, where I started out working in helpdesk and phone support for internal users. Back then I imagined no better work, than supporting users with various issues, in a company such as DR with so many interesting and creative people and projects - Actually been then I used to dispise networking!</description>
