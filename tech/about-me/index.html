<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Frederik Fibiger-Lundberg, I was born in Denmark back in October 1996, and I work with IT Networks for a living!</p>
<p>I started my IT journey in the Danish Broadcasting Cooperation (DR) as a <em>data technician apprentice</em> back in March 2015, where I started out working in helpdesk and phone support for internal users. Back then I imagined no better work, than supporting users with various issues, in a company such as DR with so many interesting and creative people and projects - Actually been then I used to dispise networking!</p>
<p>Anyway, while working in the IT servicedesk, I always got annoyed that for a lot of the issues that our users experienced, I could only provide workarounds, and not resolve the actual underlying issues and problems. However, in early 2017 I got the opportunity to join DRs network &amp; datacenter team to continue my education, while enabling me to get the opportunity and responsibility to actually fix some of all those underlying problems that had bothered me during my time in the IT servicedesk - After all user experience is key; always was, and always will be!</p>
<p>In late 2018 I got the offer to the Danish Cisco Gold partner named Wingmen Solutions as a System Engineer trainee, where I could finish the last year of my apprenticeship. Once I finished my apprenticeship, I got the offer to stick with Wingmen as a System Engineer, and this is where I&rsquo;ve been sinced then :)</p>
<p>During my time at Wingmen I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure to work with a variety of customers, colleagues and technologoies. In recent time mostly focusing on core enterprise networking, Cisco ACI, Cisco SD-WAN, and some traditional firewall and Remote Access VPN, leaving behind Wireless and server/storage for some of my fantastic and knowledgeable colleagues ;)</p>
