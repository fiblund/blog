      <description>Cilium - It&amp;rsquo;s still just BGP&amp;hellip; Continuing on my Cilium journey, here is what the Cilium BGP config for my lab looks like at the moment.
Like (basically?) everything else in kubernetes, the BGP config is also specified in YAML. In my lab all of my BGP config exists in a single YAML file that contains multiple YAML documents, with each YAML document being separated by 3 dashes ---.
The first YAML document is of the kind CiliumBGPClusterConfig, and it should be mostly self-explanatory as long as you&amp;rsquo;ve worked with BGP on a &amp;rsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo; network device 🙂 I have a single BGP instance, called instance-65010, using the ASN 65010 with a single BGP peer with the name dc-switch with IP 192.</description>

      <description>About me Hello!
My name is Frederik Fibiger-Lundberg, I was born in Denmark back in October 1996, and I work with IT Networks for a living!
I started my IT journey in the Danish Broadcasting Cooperation (DR) as a data technician apprentice back in March 2015, where I started out working in helpdesk and phone support for internal users. Back then I imagined no better work, than supporting users with various issues, in a company such as DR with so many interesting and creative people and projects.</description>
